## What is Apex OS?

Apex OS is an [AME Wizard](https://ameliorated.io) playbook that transforms a stock Windows installation into the fastest, most private, and most stable operating system possible — without reinstalling Windows or breaking core functionality.

This is not a simple debloater. Apex OS is a **complete system re-engineering** with over **1,100 precisely targeted actions** across 11 phases:

- Every telemetry endpoint is severed
- Every unnecessary service is eliminated
- Every timer and scheduler is tuned for maximum FPS
- Every network stack parameter is optimized
- Every bloatware package is surgically removed
- Every AI/Copilot/Recall component is eliminated
- Windows Defender is toggleable — disable for max FPS or keep enabled for security

> ⚠️ **WARNING**: This playbook makes deep, irreversible changes. Use only on a **fresh Windows installation**. Always create a system image backup before applying.

### Execution Order
1. **Privacy & Telemetry** → Sever all data collection first
2. **Bloatware Removal** → Remove packages while no telemetry reports it
3. **Service Optimization** → Reduce running services baseline
4. **Performance** → CPU/GPU/memory/timer/boot tuning
5. **Network** → TCP/IP stack and adapter optimization
6. **Security** → TLS/SMB/cipher/credential hardening
7. **Windows Update** → Apply user-selected update policy
8. **Interface** → Shell, taskbar, explorer, dark mode cleanup
9. **Cleanup** → Delete 70+ scheduled tasks and caches
10. **Software** → Install browser, NanaZip, VCREDIST, DirectX
11. **Finalize** → Wallpaper, branding, GPU cache clear, advanced cleanup

## FAQ

**Q: Can I undo this?**
A: System Restore is kept enabled with a minimal 3% disk allocation, so restore points are created when drivers or apps are installed. For full rollback, always create a system image backup before applying.

**Q: Will my games still work?**
A: Yes. Game Mode is enabled, Xbox gaming services are disabled but not deleted (re-enable for Game Pass if needed), and GPU/CPU/timer optimizations specifically target gaming performance. Automated VCREDIST and DirectX installation ensures maximum compatibility.

**Q: Will Windows Update still work?**
A: Depends on your selection. "Security Only" keeps critical patches flowing. "Disable All" completely stops updates. "Keep Default" leaves it unchanged.

**Q: Can I re-enable Bluetooth/printing/etc.?**
A: Bluetooth, Print Spooler, and scanner services are set to Manual (start on demand) so they work automatically when you use them. No manual re-enabling needed.

**Q: Is this safe for daily use?**
A: Yes, when installed on a fresh Windows. The playbook disables unnecessary components but preserves all core OS functionality, networking, and driver support.

**Q: Does it work on Windows 10?**
A: Yes. Apex OS supports Windows 10 21H2 (build 19044) and 22H2 (build 19045). Win11-only features (like classic context menu, snap layouts) are automatically skipped on Win10.
